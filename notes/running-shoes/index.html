                <p>
                    For my final project in Thermodynamics, we could analyze anything thermodynamically. I chose running shoes. I run cross country and track, I'd been curious about how super shoes actually worked, and it seemed like a good excuse to find out. My usual approach to gear is whatever's on sale or the brightest color, so this was a step up.
                </p>

                <h2>Shoes as Thermodynamic Systems</h2>

                <p>
                    Every stride involves mechanical work, friction, and heat — and the shoe has to manage all of it. The midsole foam compresses under your foot, stores some energy elastically, and releases it as you push off. The part it doesn't return gets lost as heat through internal damping. So energy return and heat generation are directly linked: a more efficient foam loses less energy as heat and gives more back to you as forward motion. Your body isn't great at this either — only about 20–25% of your metabolic energy actually goes toward moving you forward.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Your Shoes Feel Different in the Cold</h2>

                <p>
                    This one I found satisfying because it confirmed something I'd already noticed: shoes genuinely do feel harder in cold weather and softer when it's warm. Turns out there's a real physical reason for it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The three main foam materials — EVA, TPU, and PEBA — each have different molecular structures that determine how they respond to temperature. EVA, the most common midsole material, has a partially crystalline structure. Those ordered molecular regions restrict how freely molecules can vibrate, so in cold conditions, EVA gets significantly stiffer — up to 70% by some measurements. Less molecular motion means less cushioning. TPU and PEBA are mostly amorphous (disordered) at the molecular level, so they stay soft and responsive even when it's cold. PEBA, which Nike uses in the Vaporfly, is especially stable — its alternating soft and hard molecular segments give it both high elasticity and consistent performance across temperatures.
                </p>

                <h2>Where Heat Goes During a Run</h2>

                <p>
                    Heat moves through a shoe via conduction through the foam, airflow through the upper, and evaporation of sweat. Evaporation is surprisingly effective — sweat removes about 580 kilocalories per liter as it vaporizes. But once your socks are saturated, that drops off sharply and heat starts accumulating. Which in turn softens the foam and changes how it responds to loading. The shoe you're wearing at mile 20 is mechanically a little different from the one you started in.
                </p>

                <h2>What Actually Surprised me</h2>

                <p>
                    Researchers measured foot temperature at the heel, arch, and forefoot during running at different speeds. At slow speeds, the heel was hottest. At faster speeds, the hottest point shifted forward to the toes. That makes sense — sprinters run on their toes, so that's where the friction and ground contact are concentrated. Distance runners tend to heel strike, which is part of why heel and plantar issues are so common at longer distances. The heat distribution is basically a map of where your foot is working hardest, and it shifts with pace. I'd never thought about it that way before. But I thought it completely checked out.
                </p>

                <h2>What the Carbon Plate Actually Does</h2>

                <p>
                    The carbon plate in super shoes is often described as "giving you energy back," which is a little misleading. What it really does is reduce energy loss. It acts as a stiff spring that limits forefoot deformation, reducing the energy lost to internal damping in the foam. Less heat generated per stride means more energy returned to propulsion. A 2017 study found about a 4% improvement in running economy with carbon-plated prototypes — which sounds small, but at the marathon distance is significant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I got Vaporflys for track last year and they're genuinely different. I wish I'd had them for Grandma's Marathon, but they were a bit spendy and I didn't know I'd end up on a varsity team. It was still a good investment!
